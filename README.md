# Refractor-Challenge
This was a website model that I needed to Refractor and make sure everything was working properly. This is my first time refractoring, so it was quiet the challenge. 
I ran into issues where the buttons were not working properly and not taking you to the designated items on the page. 
I was also able to find that the heading spacing and background images were off a but as well.
